Hi, 
This is Vinay Thogaruchheti,
This is my small project which is a Dynamic website design.
I used a little bit of Html,Css,javascript,SQL,PHP in this design.
This website is like a shopping website(e.g. amazon,flipkart),
In this website we can add items to the website and provide info about that items.
I set up a local xampp server to run this website which takes the database from the
html document and send it to the server by php file which is the back-end coding language
and Sql to insert data into the database.I used a php file to coonect to my server 
and access the information from the database and display in the html document.
this is a simple dynamic website, so i didn't added more features to it.
Thank you for visiting my project :)
